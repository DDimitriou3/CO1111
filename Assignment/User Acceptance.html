<br>


<p> <b>1.</b> Visibility of system status : </p>

<ul>
    <br>
    <li>Players are informed when the app wants to use specific features such as location and camera.</li>
    <br>
    <li>When players answer a question they are notified if it was correct or wrong</li>
    <br>
</ul>

<p> <b>2.</b> The real world and the system match : </p>

<ul>
    <br>
    <li>Questions are fairly simple and straightforward.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Some questions are provided with a link for help without forcing the player to search online for meanings.</li>
    <br>
</ul>

<p> <b>3.</b> User control and freedom : </p>

<ul>
    <br>
    <li>If the player has made a mistake in answering, it allows them to answer the same question again.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Each page is provided with a home button to help players return if they accidentally pressed a button.</li>
    <br>
</ul>

<p> <b>4.</b> Consistency and standards :</p>

<ul>
    <br>
    <li>The app is consistent as the layout and design doesnt change when going to the next question. </li>
    <br>
</ul>

<p> <b>5.</b> Error prevention :</p>

<ul>
    <br>
    <li>If there is an error it notifies the player that they made a mistake thus making them fix it.</li>
    <br>
    <li>If the error is not big, the app itself takes care of it without causing any issues.</li>
    <br>
</ul>

<p> <b>6.</b> Recognition rather than recall :</p>

<ul>
    <br>
    <li>QR scans are still shown even if you continue to the next question, it doesnt make the user recall past scans.</li>
    <br>
</ul>

<p> <b>7.</b> Flexibility and efficiency :</p>

<ul>
    <br>
    <li>The standard keyboard shortcuts are functional when answering a question (e.g. copying, pasting etc.)</li>
    <br>
    <li>The app is available to anyone as the game is pretty straightforward.</li>
    <br>
</ul>

<p> <b>8.</b> Aesthetic and minimalistic design :</p>

<ul>
    <br>
    <li>The App User interface contains everything that is needed for the player to play, without unnecessary buttons.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Index page contains a menu that allows players to navigate to important parts of the app.</li>
    <br>
    <li>The aesthetic of the game is calm on the player, making him enjoy the look of the app.</li>
    <br>
</ul>

<p> <b>9.</b> Recognition, diagnostics and recovery from errors :</p>

<ul>
    <br>
    <li>If there is an error, it alerts the player with a translation from programming to regular language so the user can understand.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Errors that usually appear also guide players into understanding their mistakes.</li>
    <br>
</ul>

<p> <b>10.</b> Help and Documentation :</p>

<ul>
    <br>
    <li>The app is smooth and easy to use.</li>
    <br>
    <li>If the player needs any help, there is a help section.</li>
    <br>
</ul>
