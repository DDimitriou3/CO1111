<p11>The main purpose of developing this application is an assignment on the lesson CO11111 and more specific on the lesson of Computing Skills.Our team consists of two members. Dimitris Dimitriou and Andreas Loucaides.  </p11>
<p6>The work of each member is separated equally during the ideas of each one to the specific topic.Andreas is on the design of the page and the marketing and Dimitris on the JavaScripting and the coding behind the app.</p6>
<br>
<br>
<p9>The main aim of the team was to communicate and all of the members have a preview of everything that nothing will be lost. Communicating through Microsoft Teams mostly every Monday afternoon or some times at Fridays afternoons as well.Everyone uses Microsoft Teams group chat that was created to chat or to exchange ideas the days that we are not having a meeting.</p9>

    <b>First meeting was on the 18/01/2021 at 11 o'clock.</b>
    We had our first meeting discussing each others roles and what are our goals in completing the treasure hunt quiz.
    In the end we came to a conclusion that Dimitris Dimitriou will be dealing with the javascript and Andreas Loucaides
    with the css and marketing part. Our goal was to make an easy to use website where anyone can join and have fun with the quiz.
</p15>
<br>
<br>
<p15>
    <b>Second meeting was on the 21/01/2021 at 3 o'clock.</b>
    The second meeting took place on Thursday at 3, we decided to have this meeting quite close to the first one,
    because we wanted to use the first meeting as the basis in learning each others roles, which lead into us
    having this second meeting in discussing if anyone had any issues understanding their line of work in the quiz.
    We ended up finishing this meeting quite sooner than the first as we both understood what we had to do,
    and shared that we would start working on it as soon as we could.
</p15>
<br>
<br>
<p15>
    <b>Third meeting was 02/02/2021 at 6 o'clock.</b>
    The third meeting took approximately one and a half week later than the second one, as we wanted to give time
    to each other to work on something and actually show some progress in our meetings and discuss our thoughts,
    on what should stay and what should change. In this meeting <b>Andreas Loucaides</b> has made the first step with the
    creation of the landing page with a title, a search bar, a menu that can take the player to different parts of the
    treasure hunt such as the support page and the about us page. Below he gave some information about what the
    treasure hunt app is and some often questions that players tend to ask in situations of need. <b>Dimitris Dimitriou</b>
    could not do many changes as he needed the landing page for him to be able to work on the code and connect things,
    but ended up writing some notes down on some ideas on what he will do when the time comes to implement the functions.
    Most of those ideas was on how to implement the calls and on how to check the answer the players will be giving.
</p15>
<br>

<p15>
    <b>Fourth meeting was 15/02/2021 at 12 o'clock.</b>
    The next meeting which was our Fourth meeting noted down, we took the time to see how each of us is working,
    as we worked on the treasure hunt one of our main goals was to make sure that everyone in the team was comfortable
    and calm because that's one of the most important trinkets when it comes to a team work in anything. So as we
    cleared that everything was going well on both ends, <b>Andreas Loucaides</b> presented some more pages which was the
    support and the about us page, this time there was some more information within them, and also managed to fix some
    small issues and bugs in the home page. <b>Dimitris Dimitriou</b> on the other hand managed to implement the first step
    in the javascript code, which was to load the available treasure hunts. He mentioned that it took a bit of time
    to implement even tho it was more or less easy, because he was trying to understand the full concept of the game
    and improvise on what to implement in the future with the help of some of his ideas that he noted down before.
</p15>

    <b>Fifth meeting was 22/02/2021 at 12 o'clock.</b>
    We had our sixth meeting one week later. This was probably one of our biggest meetings as there were a lot of changes
    that needed to be shared between us. Firstly <b>Andreas Loucaides</b> added a new wallpaper on the application with a
    slideshow on the bottom of the page with some relative photos about the game. In the support page he added a
    temporary help bot, he will make it more dynamic later on, in the about us page he added some more information about
    the team and embedded our teams twitter account here with some of our latest tweets. And below that there were
    meeting notes. <b>Dimitris Dimitriou</b> on the other hand with the javascript side, he managed to implement the available
    treasure hunts loader with some better functions, created another page that is linked to the treasure hunts, such that
    when the player would click on the join under the treasure hunt it will take them to a page where it asks the players
    name through a popup, if the name is valid it continues to the game, if not it shows an alert indicating that the name
    is not allowed or its empty. When the name is valid it loads the first question with an input based on the type of
    the current question. At this point we were at the peak on speed and implementations which we liked in the end and
    kept going.
</p15>

    <b>Sixth meeting was 08/03/2021</b>
    The eighth meeting was more or less of a check up on how everyone was doing as approximately 2 weeks have passed,
    and ended up showing each other some finalized ideas and thoughts. <b>Andreas Loucaides</b> is working on making the design
    look more fresh and add some more updated versions on the support bot and some better tweets on our account. As for
    <b>Dimitris Dimitriou</b> he managed to implement everything that was needed for the treasure hunt. He had a small issue
    with getting the answer of the player and checking if it is correct or wrong, but ended up finding a solution.
    The game is at the point of playability, players can join a treasure hunt which creates a session for the character
    in the start page which redirects the player to the inGame page. In this page the first question is loaded with
    a score tracker under the answer input, and also a skip button. The score changes based on the answer of the player,
    if its correct it will increase the points by 10, if the answer is wrong it decreases by 3. And as for the skip button
    it checks if the question is skippable, if it is then the skip appears if not it doesnt appear for the player.
    Dimitris also created a geolocation function that gets the players current location and updates every 30 seconds.
    When the player is finished with the game, he/she is redirected to the leaderboard that shows the top 10 players of the game.
    We were both very happy with the outcome of the game so far and decided to make the final stretch and complete the game.
